dfs: 
    get adjacency list for given vertex.

    mark vertex as visited
    print vertex.

    while (there are nodes in the adjacency list),
        get current vertex

        check if it is visited, if it isnt,
            perform dfs for this vertex
        
        go to the next node


bfs:
    init our queue

    enqueue our given vertex
    mark it as visited
    
    while (queue isnt empty),
        current vertex = dequeue()
        print (current vertex)

        get the adjacency list for current vertex
        while (there are nodes in the adjacency list),
            get node's vertex
            check if it is visited, if it isnt,
                enqueue this vertex
                mark it as visited
            
            go to the next node
